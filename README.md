Project Title:      Rainfall in Indian States

Genral Instructions:
    After extracting the folder to a location, make sure that all the dataset files, as well as the .ipynb files are in the same folder.
    In the extracted folder, there should be 2 .pdf files (presentation and report), 2 Jupyter notebooks, 32 .csv files and 1 markdown file.
    Kindly donot change the name of the .csv files.


Libraries Used:
    numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn

Instructions to run the code:
    The Phase1_Code.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for obtaining correlation, and plotting the rainfall data of Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh for the years of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. This was the primary objective and problem statement.

  The Phase2_Code.ipynb file is a Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for further analysis on the dataset, including comparing the rainfall of Madhya Pradesh with that of 5 neighbouring and 4 distant states, and finally a model for rainfall prediction in Madhya Pradesh. In some codeblocks, GridSearchCV is used and is initially commented to prevent accidently running. To run gridsearch, the last few lines may be modified as mentioned in the codeblocks.
